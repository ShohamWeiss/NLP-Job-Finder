We believe that math and science are fascinating and beautiful, but that the tools widely used to teach it are dry and ineffective. Brilliant makes learning STEM fun, through problem solving and interactive explorations – from foundational math and science to cutting-edge computer science and professional topics. Brilliant helps over 12 million students, professionals, and lifelong learners around the world cultivate problem solving skills, build intuition, and master concepts rather than memorize them. To understand more about our approach, see our learning principles. The Role As a Creative Technologist (CT), you'll be responsible for building the interactive diagrams we use to create interaction-first courses in math, science, and computer science. You will combine your creative and technical expertise to take concept art, whiteboard sketches, and mathematical/scientific models, then translate them into visually polished and engaging interactive content. Your work will feature prominently in our web and mobile products to deliver fun and interactive learning experiences to millions of learners. We strongly believe that interactive visualizations have the potential to change how people learn math and science. A CT at Brilliant is a highly cross-functional, collaborative role that involves both art and code. As a member of the Content organization you’ll be working with other talented artists, animators, and subject matter experts in math, science, and computer science to help tell engaging stories. You’ll also collaborate with product managers and engineering teams to help improve the authoring tools and interactive frameworks you use.

Your Responsibilities Work closely with technical experts and course producers to turn concept sketches and prototypes into production-ready interactive diagrams Become masterful at using our authoring engine and make smart design decisions, all with minimal guidance Write readable, idiomatic and reusable code in Elm (using our in-house frameworks, like Diagrammar) to enable the scaling of interactive visuals across Brilliant’s content Where appropriate, build and maintain a library of reusable, well-documented code packages, to accelerate production work for yourself, other CTs, and course producers Work with artists to integrate our art style — environments, characters, objects, and color schemes — into diagrams, to build a consistent visual world of content Consistently test and iterate interactive diagrams and code packages based on feedback Your Qualities Adaptable learner: Your ability to understand and apply technical concepts extends beyond specific coding languages, and you are excited to adopt our in-house tools to realize your creative vision. Strong Communicator: You are great at giving and receiving feedback, presenting ideas to the team, and keeping the team up to date on progress and timelines. We move fast, and constant open communication is key to success in a fast-paced environment. Flexible: You can wear multiple hats and adapt to shifting timelines and goals as we work towards maturing our production process. You are also comfortable taking on both library creation and asset production responsibilities. Affinity for problem solving: You have a demonstrated ability and keen interest in tackling challenges out of your comfort zone. The majority of your work will be math- and science-focused, so enthusiasm for the material and general problem-solving aptitude will help you go far in making an impact. Suggested Requirements Ideally 2-3 years of professional working experience B.S. degree (or equivalent work experience) in design, games-related development, or a technical field (e.g. Computer Science, Computer Graphics) Background or experience in interactive media, game development, data visualization, or animation with a strong sense of interaction design and understanding of visual design (e.g., form, value, perspective, composition) Experience in internal tool development, or working knowledge of Elm and other functional programming languages, would be ideal but not required $125,000 - $180,000 a year We use a systematic compensation framework.

The Problem Globally, soils have the potential to sequester over 1 billion tons of carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and emerging solutions like biochar and enhanced rock weathering. However today, measurement, reporting, and verification of soil carbon sequestration is not cost effective, accurate, or scalable. This prevents large-scale climate finance from being deployed to rapidly scale soil carbon improvement despite its massive potential to combat climate change, improve food security, and alleviate extreme poverty. Our Company We're building technology to accelerate gigaton-scale soil carbon removal and storage around the world. To start, we are building the world's best global measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platform to accelerate high-integrity soil carbon sequestration. With Stanfords Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry Lab, we leverage technological innovation using ground truth sampling, remote sensing, and AI modeling to accurately and scalably measure soil carbon. For soil carbon project developers, we decrease the time, cost, and complexity of MRV while increasing the integrity of the carbon removal credits for carbon buyers. This enables the large-scale deployment of climate finance to incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices. We are focused on improving soil health in emerging economies to maximize global sequestration and community impact. We are a public-benefit corporation driven by passion and purpose in service to our planet, people, and prosperity. We are backed by world-class investors including, and aare advised by an all-star team of Stanford climate professors with 100,000+ citations collectively. Our Values Curiosity: Most solutions to reach net zero do not exist yet. We are looking for sensationally curious team players who use a beginners mindset to find novel solutions and embrace the growth mindset to overcome setbacks Kindness: Great teams change the world, we believe kindness is the foundation to build great teams on and also guides the impact we aim to have on our planet to pay it forward. Mamba Mentality: Kobe Bryants Mamba Mentality combines love, passion, and borderline obsession to improve every day and create a culture of collectively becoming the best we can be at our shared dream. Speed and Scale: We value teammates who are ready to move at the speed and scale necessary to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. If you are looking to coast, stick to big tech. Multidisciplinary and Multicultural Collaboration: The ability to think across disciplines and work with people from a variety of backgrounds is not just a requirement, but a unique advantage given that our work spans multiple domains and impacts communities around the world. About US We are based in the SF/Bay Area and are fostering a strong in-person first, collaborative, mission-driven culture.

ABOUT THE ROLE Managers of Data Science lead their teams to higher levels of productivity. They collaborate with their team to find what works and what changes should be made to optimize for the long term. Managers of Data Science actively participate in all aspects of product strategy. For data-driven products, managers have end-to-end ownership including designing, building, and delivering customer-facing products. Depending on your interests and background, you will tackle problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data. You have the necessary skills to roll up your sleeves and jump into data with your fellow data scientists. You can lead by example and bring your team to a solution. Managers of Data Science contribute to more than our product–they build up a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness. We expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' and convey that vision to your team. You have an abundance of curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning and developing new skills. You have strong data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what delights our clients and to move one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to support your fellow teammates. You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE You are intellectually curious and enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques. You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. Your demonstrated experience leading productive, impactful data science teams and projects is more important than your level of education. You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. We do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. We care that you learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. #LI-BM2 Our Compensation and Benefits (for NY, CO, CA, and WA residents only) At the Trade Desk, Base Salary is one part of our competitive total compensation and benefits package and is determined using a salary range.

You may have successfully helped guide the career growth of your reports or participated in the hiring process. You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role.

The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) is dedicated to sustaining healthy marine and freshwater environments. Our school comprises one of the largest and most diverse academic aquatic and fisheries sciences programs in the United States. Our faculty conduct innovative research from the organism to the ecosystem scale, and are recognized leaders in aquatic biology, sustainable fisheries management, and aquatic resource conservation. The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences values the strengths and professional experience that students, faculty, and staff bring to our community. We are committed to providing excellent education to all of our students, regardless of their race, gender, class, nationality, physical ability, religion, age, or sexual orientation. We are proud of the different roles that our students, staff, and faculty play in the community of the School and in the College of the Environment. We recognize that science is richer and the SAFS community is more vibrant when a diverse group of people participate in the SAFS community. Tele-connected distributions are ubiquitous in ecology; events in one location impact events in other locations. This project will develop methods to identify tele-connected distributions with machine learning. These methods could be used in many circumstances, including migration outcomes, connections in weather patterns, pollution impacts, and fishery dynamics. The case study for this project will be modeling larval dynamics in the Bering Sea by predicting distributions of young fish based on distributions of spawning fish that have a pelagic larval phase. Tele-connected distributions will be identified as clusters of spawning biomass and recruitment in space based on biomass, proximity, and other environmental covariates using clustering algorithms. Machine learning algorithms will be used to model each recruitment cluster based on the variability of the clusters of spawning biomass. The method will be applied to data for at least five Alaskan stocks, including snow crab (a stock recently declared overfished) and yellowfin sole. The anticipated start date is December 1, 2022, but this is negotiable. The appointment is for 1 year. Applications should be submitted by October 15, 2022, but the position will remain open until filled. This is a full-time position located at the University of Washington in Seattle. The post-doc will be supervised by Dr. André Punt (University of Washington) and Dr. Cody Szuwalski at the Alaska Fishery Science Center. Responsibilities include: Developing methods using established machine learning algorithms to identify tele-connected distributions Simulation testing the developed methods Applying the methods to five commercially fished species in the eastern Bering Sea Publishing the results in a peer-reviewed journal Presenting the results at a scientific meeting The base salary range for this position will between $5,459 and $7500 per month, commensurate with experience and qualifications, or as mandated by a U.S. Department of Labor prevailing wage determination.

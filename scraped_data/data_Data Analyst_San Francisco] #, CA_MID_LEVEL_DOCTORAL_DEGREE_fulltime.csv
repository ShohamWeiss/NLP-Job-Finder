The Curtis Laboratory is administratively situated within the Stanford Cancer Institute and is integrated within Stanford University and the School of Medicine’s Departments of Medicine (Oncology) and Genetics. The SCI is part of a Comprehensive National Cancer Institute Cancer Center for cross-disciplinary research in cancer biology involving researchers from oncology, radiobiology, computer science, genetics, statistics, and basic/translational clinical research. Our research couples state-of-the-art computational and experimental techniques to define novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers and to characterize tumor evolution. The successful candidate will be part of an interdisciplinary research team developing novel technological and methodological approaches to improve the diagnosis, treatment and earlier detection of cancer. He/she will analyze and interpret large sequencing datasets by applying and developing bioinformatics and statistical methods whole genome/exome sequencing, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, single cell, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) data. The successful candidate will interact closely with other computational and experimental biologists and clinicians to test, validate, and refine hypotheses. This is a fantastic opportunity for a motivated bioinformatician, computational genomicist to join a dynamic team with significant opportunities for scholarship and leadership. Duties include: Lead and own organization-wide data initiatives (e.g. models, frameworks, platforms, dashboards). Supervise, coach and mentor a high-performing team of analysts. Identify, leverage and partner with external firms. Prioritize and extract data from a variety of sources such as notes, survey results, medical reports, and laboratory data, and maintain its accuracy and completeness. Determine additional data collection and reporting requirements. Design and customize reports based upon data in the database. Oversee and monitor regulatory compliance for utilization of the data. Use system reports and analyses to identify potentially problematic data, make corrections, and eliminate root cause for data problems or justify solutions to be implemented by others. Create complex charts and databases, perform statistical analyses, and develop graphs and tables for publication and presentation. Test prototype software and participate in approval and release process for new software. Provide documentation based on audit and reporting criteria to investigators and research staff.

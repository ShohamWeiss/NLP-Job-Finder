HPI is comprised of two programs: CRoPS (CO2 Removal on a Planetary Scale), which aims to develop crops called Salk Ideal Plants™ that can store more carbon in the ground for longer; and CPR (Coastal Plant Restoration), which is working toward genetically informed restoration and preservation of the world’s wetlands, which act as signiﬁcant carbon sinks. In addition, more ground carbon means farmers benefit from improved soil health. To accomplish this end, the Salk’s HPI aims to understand which genes and molecular processes determine root traits that potentially increase carbon sequestration growth, as well as to test plant lines with such traits in lab, greenhouse and field environments and assess their effect on soil carbon accumulation and permanence. This research is directly leveraged in the pioneering CRoPS project that aims to develop crop plants that sequester more carbon via extensive root systems containing recalcitrant carbon polymers to fight climate change. For this we are working to enhance the carbon sequestration capacity in several important crop species throughout different soil types and geographies. We are currently seeking a highly motivated and independent Software Engineer (full stack developer) to contribute to the system architecture (including design patterns, reliability, and scaling) of new and current systems for lab, greenhouse, and field trials data management. As such, the Software Engineer will interface with several Salk scientists and collaborating plant biology and soil scientists to contribute and develop and scale such systems. Ideal candidates should be passionate about mitigating climate change, intellectually curious, highly productive, and enjoy working in a committed and diverse team driven to uncover new and impactful solutions with application to the larger problem of climate change. The Software Engineer will join a vibrant group of molecular biologists, plant geneticists, computational biologists, and soils scientists to work in a team that is determined to address a global problem with the power of plant biology and soil science.

Hyperscalers are keen on how to gain COGS efficiencies with the trillions of AI inferences/day they are already serving, but certainly for addressing the steep demand ramp they are anticipating in the next couple of years. d-Matrix is addressing this problem head on by developing a fully digital in memory computing accelerator for AI inference that is highly optimized for the computational patterns in Transformers and generative AI. d-Matrix’s AI inference accelerator has also been architected as a chiplet, thereby enabling both a scale-up and scale-out solution with flexible packaging options. The d-Matrix team has a stellar track record in developing and commercializing silicon at scale as senior execs at the likes of Inphi, Broadcom, and Intel. Notably, they recognized early the extremely important role of programmability and the software stack and are thoughtfully building up the team in this area even since before their Series A.

These positions are based in Dallas (Texas), and Jacksonville (Florida) for students with targeted graduation dates between December 2023 and May 2024. The Summer Analyst program starts in June and runs for 10 weeks. The best way to think about PBWMT is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.

Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry iOS: Swift, Xcode Android: Java, Android Studio, Kotlin Web: Angular (version 9), TypeScript While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills.

You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas. Interns in this track will be considered for full-time Software Development offers after graduation, with the freedom to again choose between the four roles above. Over time, you would have the option to become a full-stack developer or specialize.

You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development. Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings. Our Organization The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day. No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people. Your Role You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year. You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work. You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed. While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories: Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company. Mobility We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams. Training Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi. But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset. Communication/Leadership While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas. The Most Important Thing We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude. We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it. This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed. If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!

You are someone who recognizes potential pain points in the design of a system, knows how to utilize the best tool for the job, and apply the best estimates when interfacing with the stakeholders. You are not the type to sit on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you what to do next. You are someone who will continue to develop valuable skills such as big-picture prototyping, breaking down large tasks into smaller, testable pieces, and expanding your software capabilities. We seek problem solvers, not problem finders, and we hold our engineers to a high standard of productivity. There are no ""weak links"" at Sparx.

At Sparx you will work with clients on projects involving everything from embedded microcontrollers, to media and image processing, to Bluetooth and TCP communications, to server-side database, web, and mobile app development. You will use a variety of languages from C to VHDL to Scala to C# .NET to Objective-C, all the way up the stack with languages such as JavaScript and Kotlin and Swift, often switching between them on a daily basis. As such, you should have a proven track record of being able to pick up new languages and technologies, be multi-faceted in your skillset and interests, and preferably have some history of ""tinkering"" in your spare time. We operate across many fields such as oil and gas, medical, robotics, industrial automation and consumer products. You will be exposed to many types of technology and have the opportunity to hone your current expertise and learn skills both within and outside of the software engineering spectrum, such as electronics and advanced data analysis. You will be working in small teams with other highly skilled engineers and developers to create products and software services from most every industry. Expect to be constantly challenged as part of an organization that strives to push the technological envelope in delivering innovative solutions to customer problems. Sparx is a casual and highly collaborative work environment. Our relatively small team helps us utilize the best of each player on different projects. Responsibilities Design and implement software of embedded devices and systems from requirements to production and commercial deployment Work directly with engineering peers from all disciplines to create new technologies for multiple industries Communicate and appropriately document engineering designs at all phases of the product lifecycle Requirements Unless you can prove that you are a phenomenal developer through extensive work history, a minimum of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering or similar is required. Experience in the following areas is also preferred: Dedication to proper source control methods Strong problem solving and communication (verbal and written) skills Excellent mathematics skills Experience in testing and troubleshooting Experience interfacing with internal/external customers and vendors Proven working experience in software engineering Experience in hands-on development and troubleshooting on embedded targets Solid programming experience in C or C++ Proven experience in embedded systems design with preemptive, multitasking real-time operating systems Familiarity with software configuration management tools, defect tracking tools, and peer review Excellent knowledge of OS coding techniques, IP protocols, interfaces and hardware subsystems Adequate knowledge of reading schematics and data sheets for components Strong documentation and writing skills At Sparx, we move quickly and work on a wide variety of projects. Our engineers are challenged daily and must be versatile. You may be introduced to a technology stack that you have limited familiarity in, especially those that deal with the fast-paced nature of emerging technologies from machine learning to virtual reality and various modern tools and libraries. Therefore, given the diversity of our projects, we are more concerned with your work ethic and your fit than your experience in any specific technology. You will also be dealing directly with clients, on the front line, so it is important for you to be able to recognize and apply the proper software lifecycle procedures and methodologies in order to help them meet their needs in an efficient and predictable manner. You are someone who recognizes potential pain points in the design of a system, knows how to utilize the best tool for the job, and apply the best estimates when interfacing with the stakeholders. You are not the type to sit on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you what to do next.

Job Description Arista Networks is looking for world-class Senior/Lead Linux Kernel and BIOS software engineers to join our Kernel software team. Our Kernel team is responsible for keeping pace with the latest developments in the Linux Kernel and integrating them for our internal use, both for development and as a base for Arista EOS to run on. This work often involves extending and developing new kernel features related to functionality that we rely on and working with the kernel community to get them integrated upstream. Kernel software engineers are also responsible for the CPU subsystems on all Arista products. You will evaluate new CPUs and work with CPU/BIOS vendors to integrate their stacks into EOS. You will also be responsible for bringup and qualification of these components into our hardware products. Arista Software Engineering roles demand a strong and broad software engineering background. While the primary focus area for this role is Kernel/BIOS software, the role will cover all aspects of software development spanning the addition of new features, debugging problems and fine tuning code for scalability and performance. You will own your projects from definition to deployment and customer interactions, and you will be responsible for the quality of everything you deliver. Arista Software Engineering prides itself on a supportive and growth oriented culture. Over time, as your interests change, coupled with evolving business needs you will have the opportunity to switch from Kernel and BIOS to other areas, if you like. Responsibilities Track ongoing developments in the Linux Kernel and identify features and functionality of interest to Arista for our products and for internal development needs. Develop and maintain Kernel features and tests using C, C++ and Python, review and contribute to functional and design specifications. Build automated tests and test infrastructure to validate the features. Work with hardware engineers and vendors to qualify new Kernel dependent hardware components like CPUs and NICs for integration into Arista products. Architect and develop new BIOS features for Arista products. Work with the Kernel community to contribute features back to the mainstream. Work with a team of Kernel engineers to integrate new versions of the Kernel for use in EOS and our internal development. Provide technical leadership across features, projects and tools. Work with Customer Support Engineers and customers to analyze, mitigate and fix problems in customer networks. Work with the System Test Engineers to analyze problems found in their tests and provide fixes for those problems. Mentor new and junior engineers to bring them up to speed in Arista's software development environment. Qualifications BS Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering + 8 years experience, or MS Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering + 6 years experience, or Ph.D. in Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering + 3 years experience, or equivalent work experience Expert knowledge of C or C++ and Python. Hands-on experience working on Linux Kernel software is a plus. Understanding of IP networking and/or distributed systems is a plus. Applied understanding of software engineering principles. Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills. Ability to design a solution and implement features independently. Ability to work in small teams.

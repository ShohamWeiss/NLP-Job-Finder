Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. About our Client Our client is a serverless infrastructure company that has built a global state management platform for web developers. Their mission is to fundamentally change how software is built on the Internet and who gets to build it. They're looking for people who are passionate about improving the development experience for frontend engineers and who have strong opinions on what kinds of tools and workflows will remove barriers to getting things done. The early team at our client includes Principal Engineers and Engineering Directors who have led exabyte-scale storage projects, built custom global databases with trillions of records, and shipped desktop and mobile software onto billions of devices. They're a startup however and they're all excited about getting stuff done wherever is required in the stack. They've started to create something they believe is an entirely new and substantially better platform for teams of the future. They're eager to create the solution they wished they'd had for all those tricky frontend and backend problems they've wrestled to the ground over the years. They're motivated by the prospect of a new wave of teams using their product and excited to empower them to solve challenges that only recently were quite daunting. What excites them: They're looking for both junior and senior engineers who have a passion for building great things in a great environment. If you're highly-motivated, able to work independently, but also like to collaborate and work within a team, you're probably a good fit. Yes, they're building a state-of-the-art distributed database, so they have some very deep and very interesting systems challenges for infrastructure folks, but hopefully, folks who are also happy to also build a dashboard or work on developer SDKs. They're not just hiring infrastructure engineers however; most of their work is best applicable to general full-stack engineers with good taste and a product mindset. The Role: The Convex team has a lot of experience running large systems at scale but we have a growing infrastructure footprint across databases, servers, and devops. We are looking for a backend engineer to help build and maintain infrastructure for the future of Convex at scale. If you are passionate about building distributed systems and experienced with both designing and operating container infrastructure at scale, we would love to talk to you! What You’ll Do: Design, build, and maintain their global cloud infrastructure on AWS General ownership of SRE/DevOps which includes automating their monitoring and logging tools, developing traffic infrastructure for efficient and secure routing requests, managing release processing, versioning and CI/CD Establish reliability guidelines and ensuring systems meet our goals around durability, availability and performance Requirements: BS in Computer Science or related technical field or equivalent technical experience 7+ years of backend engineering experience working on infrastructure, production engineering, SRE, or systems engineering Good understanding of best practices for system configuration, building internal systems from scratch, and deploying services Experience scaling in a high growth startup environment Ability to write high quality code (knowledge of Rust is a plus) Location: They view in-person time as essential to make quick strategic decisions, to build empathy and to form early team culture. But they also value that working from home allows productive heads-down execution, extra time with family, commute breaks, and schedule flexibility. So, they're currently following a three/two hybrid schedule: three days in the office and (optionally) two days at home. Therefore, interested candidates need to be either in the NYC or willing to relocate. Fully remote is not an option at this time. Benefits: They have competitive salaries, generous early-employee equity packages, excellent benefits, and lots of plants in the office! Most of all however, they're a group of friendly, highly-motivated people who love working together and hope that you'll love working with them too.

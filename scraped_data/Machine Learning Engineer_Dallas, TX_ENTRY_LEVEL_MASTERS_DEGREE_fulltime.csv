Our programs equip you with the knowledge and training you need to play a valuable role on your team and establish a long-term career here. At Citi, we value internal mobility, and career growth is not a question of if, but when. Citi’s Personal Banking & Wealth Management Technology Analyst Program (PBWMT) is seeking students for the software development track of its Summer Analyst program. These positions are based in Dallas (Texas), and Jacksonville (Florida) for students with targeted graduation dates between December 2023 and May 2024. The Summer Analyst program starts in June and runs for 10 weeks. The best way to think about PBWMT is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day. We provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed. Starting in June, the PWBMT Summer Analyst Program provides a 10-week immersive experience in one of our PBWMT teams. There are three tracks within this program: Software Development (iOS, Android, Angular, Java) Data & Analytics (Data Engineer, Machine Learning & Visualization) Analyst (Project Management, Product Management & More) Each track focuses on different skillsets, has its own application/interview process, and leads to full-time opportunities.

At Sparx you will work with clients on projects involving everything from embedded microcontrollers, to flight systems, and everything in between. You will utilize your knowledge of state machines, control theory and real-time operating systems to implement complex control systems on a wide variety of systems often switching between them on a daily basis. As such, you should have a proven track record of being able to pick up new platforms and technologies, be multi-faceted in your skillset and interests, and preferably have some history of ""tinkering"" in your spare time. You will use your computer programming skills to implement closed loop control systems on a wide range of embedded systems for real-time control. These systems are targeted across many fields such as oil and gas, medical, robotics, industrial automation, consumer products, and aerospace. You will be exposed to many types of technology and have the opportunity to hone your current expertise and learn skills both within and outside of the control systems and software engineering spectrum, such as electronics and advanced data analysis. You will be working in small teams with other highly skilled engineers and developers to create products and software services from most every industry. Expect to be constantly challenged as part of an organization that strives to push the technological envelope in delivering innovative solutions to customer problems. Sparx is a casual and highly collaborative work environment. Our relatively small team helps us utilize the best of each player on different projects. Requirements Unless you can prove that you are a phenomenal developer through extensive work history, a minimum of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering or similar is required. Experience in the following areas is also preferred: Dedication to proper source control methods Strong problem solving and communication (verbal and written) skills Excellent mathematics skills Experience in testing and troubleshooting Experience interfacing with internal/external customers and vendors Knowledge of feedback control systems and control theory, including classical and modern techniques: PID, frequency domain compensation, root locus, LQR, Kalman filters, and model predictive control. Experience with real-time, deterministic programming, including scheduling, schedule analysis, with real-time operating systems and without any operating system. Knowledge and demonstrated experience in computer programming. Experience preferred in the following languages: C++ (C++11 and above preferred), C, Python, and any assembly language. Knowledge of embedded programming, including interrupt controllers, driver development, memory-mapped I/O, digital bus communications (I2C, SPI, CAN), networking, and flash memory. Knowledge of, and ability to work within aerospace industry regulatory standards regarding quality assurance, design assurance, conformity, and configuration control, including, without limitation, RTCA/DO-178C. At Sparx, we move quickly and work on a wide variety of projects. Our engineers are challenged daily and must be versatile. You may be introduced to a technology stack that you have limited familiarity in, especially those that deal with the fast-paced nature of emerging technologies from machine learning to virtual reality and various modern tools and libraries. Therefore, given the diversity of our projects, we are more concerned with your work ethic and your fit than your experience in any specific technology. You will also be dealing directly with clients, on the front line, so it is important for you to be able to recognize and apply the proper software lifecycle procedures and methodologies in order to help them meet their needs in an efficient and predictable manner. You are someone who recognizes potential pain points in the design of a system, knows how to utilize the best tool for the job, and apply the best estimates when interfacing with the stakeholders. You are not the type to sit on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you what to do next. You are someone who will continue to develop valuable skills such as big-picture prototyping, breaking down large tasks into smaller, testable pieces, and expanding your software capabilities. We seek problem solvers, not problem finders, and we hold our engineers to a high standard of productivity. There are no ""weak links"" at Sparx. In this highly collaborative and engaging environment, you will have the opportunity to work with, and learn from, a talented group of individuals, being exposed to a vast array of different domains and expertise. You will be surrounded by high performers and every member of our team is able to trust each other to get their job done effectively.

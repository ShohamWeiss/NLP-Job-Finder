The Problem Globally, soils have the potential to sequester over 1 billion tons of carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and emerging solutions like biochar and enhanced rock weathering. However today, measurement, reporting, and verification of soil carbon sequestration is not cost effective, accurate, or scalable. This prevents large-scale climate finance from being deployed to rapidly scale soil carbon improvement despite its massive potential to combat climate change, improve food security, and alleviate extreme poverty. Our Company We're building technology to accelerate gigaton-scale soil carbon removal and storage around the world. To start, we are building the world's best global measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platform to accelerate high-integrity soil carbon sequestration. With Stanfords Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry Lab, we leverage technological innovation using ground truth sampling, remote sensing, and AI modeling to accurately and scalably measure soil carbon. For soil carbon project developers, we decrease the time, cost, and complexity of MRV while increasing the integrity of the carbon removal credits for carbon buyers. This enables the large-scale deployment of climate finance to incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices. We are focused on improving soil health in emerging economies to maximize global sequestration and community impact. We are a public-benefit corporation driven by passion and purpose in service to our planet, people, and prosperity. We are backed by world-class investors including, and aare advised by an all-star team of Stanford climate professors with 100,000+ citations collectively. Our Values Curiosity: Most solutions to reach net zero do not exist yet. We are looking for sensationally curious team players who use a beginners mindset to find novel solutions and embrace the growth mindset to overcome setbacks Kindness: Great teams change the world, we believe kindness is the foundation to build great teams on and also guides the impact we aim to have on our planet to pay it forward. Mamba Mentality: Kobe Bryants Mamba Mentality combines love, passion, and borderline obsession to improve every day and create a culture of collectively becoming the best we can be at our shared dream. Speed and Scale: We value teammates who are ready to move at the speed and scale necessary to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. If you are looking to coast, stick to big tech. Multidisciplinary and Multicultural Collaboration: The ability to think across disciplines and work with people from a variety of backgrounds is not just a requirement, but a unique advantage given that our work spans multiple domains and impacts communities around the world. About US We are based in the SF/Bay Area and are fostering a strong in-person first, collaborative, mission-driven culture.

This candidate will have the exciting opportunity to stand-up a software test automation paradigm for an up-and-coming Skunkworks program. This test automation infrastructure (and the subject software being tested) heavily utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products such as Red Hat Linux’s Ansible, Cucumber, Kubernetes, Helm, and Gitlab. This assortment of products is “strung together” to bring cutting-edge software automation capabilities to the defense industry, perhaps for the first time. Because of this, the selected candidate will be a self-starter, operating on a small team of high performing self-starters, and implementing these COTS tools in novel ways on air-gapped (classified) networks. In addition to standing up the test automation infrastructure, the candidate will help spearhead an effort to integrate data analysis tools / scripts into the automation. These scripts will analyze near real-time software-performance data based on criteria defined by the developers of the subject software, and the results of said analysis will be relayed back to those developers for the purposes of test-driven and analysis-driven development. In addition to these purposes, software performance will be characterized (via visualizations) for other non-developer stakeholders. The greater TP E test team operates in a MS context, but may also interface with Vehicle System teams to solve system-of-system level challenges. This team is responsible for all system level testing of some very exciting Tactical Aviation MS efforts spanning an highly diverse array of capabilities and contexts. This includes both mission-related capabilities (air system lethality and survivability) and core infrastructure capabilities (system health, diagnostics, etc.). Candidate must be willing to learn new and eclectic technical skills outside of their comfort-zone and be open-minded to diving into whatever technical challenges encountered. Excellent communication skills are required to interact with internal and external parties. While this communication will primarily serve the purpose of describing our products and results of testing / analysis to stakeholders, there will likely be circumstances where communicating the program-level vision and purpose will be required. The successful candidate will need to pass a security screening before interview. Must be a US Citizen. This position is located at a facility that requires special access and a security clearance. While situational telecommuting will be permitted, the expectation is that the candidate will be operating full-time in a classified program space located on Lockheed Martin property in Fort Worth.

Job Responsibilities Systems Engineer Fort Worth, Texas JOB ID: 633215BR Date posted: Mar. 27, 2023 Locations: Fort Worth, Texas Description: We are Lockheed Martin Candidate will join a Mission Systems (MS) Test Planning and Execution (TP E) Team within an Integration and Test (I T) Organization responsible for the I T of Tactical Aviation MS capabilities. This candidate will have the exciting opportunity to stand-up a software test automation paradigm for an up-and-coming Skunkworks program. This test automation infrastructure (and the subject software being tested) heavily utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products such as Red Hat Linux’s Ansible, Cucumber, Kubernetes, Helm, and Gitlab. This assortment of products is “strung together” to bring cutting-edge software automation capabilities to the defense industry, perhaps for the first time. Because of this, the selected candidate will be a self-starter, operating on a small team of high performing self-starters, and implementing these COTS tools in novel ways on air-gapped (classified) networks. In addition to standing up the test automation infrastructure, the candidate will help spearhead an effort to integrate data analysis tools / scripts into the automation. These scripts will analyze near real-time software-performance data based on criteria defined by the developers of the subject software, and the results of said analysis will be relayed back to those developers for the purposes of test-driven and analysis-driven development. In addition to these purposes, software performance will be characterized (via visualizations) for other non-developer stakeholders. The greater TP E test team operates in a MS context, but may also interface with Vehicle System teams to solve system-of-system level challenges. This team is responsible for all system level testing of some very exciting Tactical Aviation MS efforts spanning an highly diverse array of capabilities and contexts. This includes both mission-related capabilities (air system lethality and survivability) and core infrastructure capabilities (system health, diagnostics, etc.). Candidate must be willing to learn new and eclectic technical skills outside of their comfort-zone and be open-minded to diving into whatever technical challenges encountered. Excellent communication skills are required to interact with internal and external parties. While this communication will primarily serve the purpose of describing our products and results of testing / analysis to stakeholders, there will likely be circumstances where communicating the program-level vision and purpose will be required. The successful candidate will need to pass a security screening before interview. Must be a US Citizen. This position is located at a facility that requires special access and a security clearance. While situational telecommuting will be permitted, the expectation is that the candidate will be operating full-time in a classified program space located on Lockheed Martin property in Fort Worth.

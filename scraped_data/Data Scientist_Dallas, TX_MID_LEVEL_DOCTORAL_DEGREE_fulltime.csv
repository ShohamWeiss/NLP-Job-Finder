It is responsible for all post model development analytics related to models developed by RMA teams, including Ongoing Performance Assessments (OPA), Annual Model Reviews (AMR), and Revalidations. Members of the MAG will be actively involved in different aspects of the model lifecycle. A typical model goes through different stages: design, calibration, testing, documentation, validation, implementation, monitoring and back to re-design and re-calibration when relevant assumptions change or monitoring indicates performance issues. OPAs and AMRs are critical stages of the model lifecycle to determine model performance (model use and monitoring) that can trigger model re-design or re-calibration by identifying critical issues. Thus the job is related to a critical stage/decision point; essentially whether or not the model can still be used, which in turn has a material impact on resources, timelines, and deliverables. Key mandates also include driving productivity enhancements in Model Analysis through innovation. The MAG will leverage cutting edge software and technology to reimagine the way we currently execute on this crucial phase of the model lifecycle, to the benefit of our partners, including model sponsors, developers, and Model Risk Management.

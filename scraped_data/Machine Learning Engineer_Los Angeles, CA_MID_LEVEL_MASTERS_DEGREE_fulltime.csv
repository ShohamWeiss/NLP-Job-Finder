You'll help to grow that team over time with diverse top tier talent that you help bring on board to fill roles in mechanical, robotics, electrical, powertrain, aerodynamics, and software engineering.

Your approach to work You feel comfortable working in grey areas and can take intelligent action without all the information being available, but you can justify with the best numbers you can run in the moment Vibrant curiosity; you take a keen interest in the product and the tools and processes you use, to continually improve the work of the whole company and deepen your own knowledge and capability. Extremely high levels of self-motivation – this is a small team that requires everyone to take the initiative even if it’s outside their comfort zone.

Who We Are Seaflight is a young company on a mission to accelerate an electric and equitable future for flight. And we’re doing it with friendly robots! We design, build, test and manufacture uncrewed (drone) electric flying machines to deliver cargo with world-beating aerodynamic efficiency. We’re a Y Combinator (S22) startup that’s venture-backed by top-tier VCs, with R&D funding from the government too. We’re based in sunny South Bay Los Angeles, not too far from the beaches. The company is first developing remote-piloted wingships that will fly in ground effect to offer a highly efficient, extremely low-cost, quick-to-market way to establish logistics service in some of the world’s most difficult-to-serve markets. Taking advantage of several proprietary, cutting-edge technologies we’re developing to do this, a much broader range of applications is on the horizon as we aim to be a global leader in middle mile drone capability as well as a high-value developer of key tech for all forms of electric flight. We're showing it’s possible now to cut costs, cut emissions, cut time, and cut worries with electric flight that is focused on extreme efficiency, not crazy complexity. We celebrate differences and are committed to a diverse workplace that fosters inclusion for employees from different backgrounds and experiences. You see sentences like that that a lot, so here’s the most obvious real example - sure, we’re dealing with small number statistics right now, but our current workforce is 50% female and features citizens of 4 different countries.

This vision is relevant because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies. We want to help them make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially. We believe that doing so will be transformational to their lives and their long-term future. About Wealthfront Engineering At Wealthfront, engineering is the largest group with over 50% of the employees. Hence engineering culture permeates throughout the organization. You will work with and learn from invigorating colleagues who come from diverse backgrounds. Very few had a finance background before starting at Wealthfront. Given our size - about 240 employees in total and about 125 employees in Engineering, you have the ability to have an outsized impact, regardless of your industry tenure. Our Banking system was designed and first developed by an engineer 3 years out of college. The Linking platform was developed by engineers with up to 6 years industry experience. When you start we will pair you up with a mentor who will guide you for as long as you want. Our culture is optimized for continued learning and automation. At Wealthfront we are builder/operators: engineers have the dual responsibility to build the system and operate the system in production, dealing with problems as they occur. This provides you direct feedback on how your code performs in production. We preach and practice automation. As an engineer, you are expected to automate any toil you encounter. No permissions required, no prioritizations expected, no questions asked. We are disciples of quality and we don’t have a separate QA organization. Engineers are expected to write automated test cases that build upon the existing test cases. For example, our investing algorithms have a dedicated suite of tests that runs full trading day simulations on a representative sample of real accounts. This testing framework allows us to test any code change against historical scenarios. If our culture of learning, the potential to have a huge impact, and our focus on quality resonates with you, then we want you! Note: This role has the option to be based in Palo Alto CA, Boston MA, or remote (U.S) About the Role: We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance. You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems. Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team. About You: You have 1-3 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay). You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment. While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate. Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger). You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field. Once you join, Wealthfront will: Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team Estimated annual salary range: $142,000 - $169,000 USD plus Equity.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. About Wealthfront Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $27 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity. In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco’s Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Observability business. About the Role The goal of full stack observability (FSO) is to provide customers end-to-end visibility into infrastructure (cloud or native), applications, networks, the Internet, and everything in between. With ThousandEyes' unprecedented visibility into application and internet performance, we can help root cause issues that are impacting business-critical experiences and give customers confidence in their ability to solve issues and deliver stellar experiences. As a part of this team, you will build an Open Telemetry platform for sharing fine-grained telemetry data to customers and partners as well as ingesting data and configurations into the ThousandEyes platform.

Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colourful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us.

By manufacturing the precision instruments at the core of this technology as well as developing the algorithms that enable cogent information to be derived from the data, we are transforming how world-class scientific, industrial and regulatory compliance measurements are made, and more importantly, who makes them. Infrared optical spectroscopy is a proven technology for delivering precise, real-time measurement of the constituents in a gas stream with high sensitivity and selectivity. Recent developments in laser technology allow for a very significant increase in the number of species that can be measured simultaneously, leading to an unprecedented increase in the amount of information that can be collected and to corresponding challenges in extracting information from the results.

Apply now Apply now save-icon Job details Salary $164,200 - $241,700 a year Job Type Full-time Who We Are The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see what's not ordinarily possible, and the ability to collect intelligence from vantage points as diverse and global as the Internet. As organizations depend on cloud services, the Internet has become their defacto network connecting cloud applications to users. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform is like a 'Google maps of the Internet', providing the only collectively powered view of digital experiences end-to-end. We enable our customers made up of the world's largest and fastest-growing brands, to identify problems before they impact revenue, brand reputation, or employee productivity. In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco's Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco's growing Observability business. What You'll Do As a Lead Software Engineer on the Account Management Platform team, you will be responsible for maintaining critical platform APIs such as user management, authentication, and contract enforcement. You will also design and implement microservices that handle high velocity API calls from internal and external systems, as well as orchestrating how these microservices work together to deliver data through our web portal to our customers. What We're Looking For 8+ years of software development experience Excited to grow your technical skills in an environment that thrives on innovation Comfortable working with newer technologies Expert level understanding of object oriented programming languages (Java, C++, etc) Familiar with, and a proponent of, test driven development Experience with SAML and SSO implementations is a plus Experience in an agile team focused on business value is a plus Experience with network protocols is a plus Strong Computer Science fundamentals Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar COMPENSATION RANGE 164200 USD - 241700 USD Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S.: When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process. U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program. Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid. Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colourful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us. We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

ABOUT THE ROLE Managers of Data Science lead their teams to higher levels of productivity. They collaborate with their team to find what works and what changes should be made to optimize for the long term. Managers of Data Science actively participate in all aspects of product strategy. For data-driven products, managers have end-to-end ownership including designing, building, and delivering customer-facing products. Depending on your interests and background, you will tackle problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data. You have the necessary skills to roll up your sleeves and jump into data with your fellow data scientists. You can lead by example and bring your team to a solution.

We are a global team with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate.

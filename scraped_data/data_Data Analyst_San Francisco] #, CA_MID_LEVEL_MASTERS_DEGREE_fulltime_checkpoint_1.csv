In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three year period specified above. Candidates must achieve a passing score on the examination in order to be placed on the resulting eligible list. Candidate scores on this examination may also be applied to other announcements involving other job titles, when directed by the Human Resources Director.

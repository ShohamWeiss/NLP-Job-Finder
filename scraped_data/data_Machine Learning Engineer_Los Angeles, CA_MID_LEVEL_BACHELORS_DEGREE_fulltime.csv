Job Summary Caltech scientists are now embarking upon a major project to develop nanotechnology enabling deep profiling of the single-cell proteome and metabolome. This work is being pursued in close collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific. To enable this effort a cohort of scientists/engineers will be hired to work at Caltech (Pasadena, CA, USA) in complementary areas spanning proteomics and single-cell analysis, nanosystems development, high frequency/microwave engineering, optics and integrated photonics, software-defined instrumentation, and bioinformatics enabled by AI/machine learning. This job posting is part of the effort to assemble this project. This job posting solicits applicants for three positions involving all aspects of micro-/nano- fabrication of novel nanodevices that merge MEMS/NEMS technology, micro-/nano-electronics, integrated photonics, and microfluidics. The engineer will interact daily with the device research & design team comprising the project PI, engineering staff, and academic researchers. This work will utilize the successful candidates' deep experience and significant achievements in nanotechnology to conceptualize and implement practical fabrication strategies from engineering plans devised by the project team. These strategies will then be employed by the successful candidates to create first prototypes comprising insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and piezoelectric materials - and then to refine protocols and process flows to enhance device quality and yield. The successful candidates will create several initial generations of device prototypes within Caltech's Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI). Subsequently, successful candidates will have the opportunity take part in commercialization of optimized devices in collaboration with the team's microelectronic foundry partners. Candidates will be considered at both the senior and junior levels. Salary will be commensurate with the successful candidate's experience. Successful candidates will work harmoniously and daily with the full engineering team to understand and optimize fabrication tasks and then devise the fabrication workflow independently and creatively. Senior candidates may also be tasked with both supervision and daily work alongside junior fabrication engineers within the cleanroom.

Essential Job Duties The job tasks will comprise the complete spectrum of micro- and nano-fabrication tasks in Caltech's KNI, a state-of-the-art cleanroom facility. Among such tasks are: CAD layout and mask design, electron beam pattern generation and lithography (with proximity correction), optical lithography, plasma etching and deposition, e-beam and thermal material deposition, and other related micro-/nano-fabrication processes. Process flow validation and optimization: including use of optical microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, focused ion beam systems, as well as profilometers, parameter analyzers, and related tools to evaluate device characteristics and to iteratively improve device performance and fabrication yield. Participation in research teams and project planning. Development of test procedures and documentation to enable a smooth and timely transfer of devices developed to experimental instrumentation. Additionally, successful candidates: must be able to lift at least 20 pounds, but heavy or continual lifting not expected - may be required to travel infrequently for this project Basic Qualifications B.S. or higher degree is required in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, or a related discipline in the physical or engineering sciences. At least five years of recent, hands-on micro- or nano-fabrication experience in a state-of-the-art cleanroom environment is required. Good written and oral communication skills. Ability to understand and solve complex design challenges both independently and as part of a team. High attention to detail and organizational skills. Excellent time management skills and ability to prioritize and process multiple tasks. Preferred Qualifications M.S. or Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Physics, or related disciplines. A successful track record in carrying out research and creative problem-solving in the physical or engineering sciences, demonstrated by refereed publications. A significant track record innovating novel micro-/nano-devices, demonstrated by a portfolio of micrographs representing the candidate's successful micro/nanofabrication achievements. Required Documents Curriculum vitae, including refereed publications and patents (applications or awarded). Academic transcripts and documentation of awarded degree(s). Cover letter including a statement of mid- to long-term career goals.

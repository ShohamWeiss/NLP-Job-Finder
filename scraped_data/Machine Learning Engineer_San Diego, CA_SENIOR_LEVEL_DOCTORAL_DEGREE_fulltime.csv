Our goal is to make protein sequencing easy and ubiquitous by using a novel reverse-translation technology that turns peptide sequences into DNA. The DNA can be read by a DNA sequencer, providing a path to breakthrough proteomics research at a scale that is not practical or cost-effective using current technologies. Job Summary We are seeking an experienced, motivated, and innovative Computational Scientist to join our Protein Engineering team. The ideal candidate should be an excellent collaborator and have experience applying state-of-the-art machine learning and computational methods to design novel peptides and proteins, such as structural modeling and prediction, structure library generation, molecular docking, and multiparameter molecular property optimization. Your Responsibilities Develop and implement a computational platform for designing proteins, de novo proteins using state-of-the-art computational modeling, simulation, docking and machine learning approaches. Design proteins with new functional properties using rational protein engineering methods, and apply these in-silico predictions to lead the development process. Discover new scaffolds/structure-function relationships and macromolecular design principles based on experimental data and metagenomic datasets. Work closely with molecular biology, biochemistry, protein science, and bioinformatics teams to improve an iterative scientific workflow. Train and direct junior scientists for protein design and characterization to improve desired properties Prepare and review patent documentation Analyze, interpret, document and present data to the scientific and leadership team Write internal scientific reports and articles for publication Maintain a broad awareness of the developments in computational protein design Work within a collaborative, and interdisciplinary team to actively contribute to creating, shaping, and executing the vision of the company Requirements What you bring to this role PhD or equivalent in computational biology, computational chemistry, biochemistry, molecular Biology, structural biology, or related field of study 10+ years experience in computational protein design, modeling, simulation, structure-function prediction, and NGS Proficient in Python and significant experience with relevant macromolecular modeling software (i.e. PyRosetta, AlphaFold, MOE, Schrödinger, Discovery studio) Fluent coding skills in one or more programming languages (e.g. Python, C++, or MATLAB, R, bash, Linux and unix commands. Experience working with molecular biology and synthetic biology teams for making DNA libraries (combinatorial libraries, site saturation libraries) Experience with cloud computing (i.e. AWS) and software Experience with devising and implementing Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) methods for protein modeling or design, or with deep learning methods that relate protein sequence, structure, property or function (e.g., structure prediction, annotation, novel or variant sequence generation, affinity/stability prediction, directed evolution, etc.) Proven ability to work across teams of software engineers, data scientists, proteomics, and chemistry to develop protein sequencing platforms. Familiar with directed evolution including yeast/phage/snap display, bioinformatics, NGS data analysis for library enrichment Successful Candidate Will Work independently for designing protein with desired attributes using in-silico methods as well as biochemical techniques. Have a track record of designing experiments, coordinating with team members, and collaborating across disciplines to accomplish projects with deadlines.

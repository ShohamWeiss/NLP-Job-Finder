We create communities that our residents are proud to call home and currently own twelve of them across four states. Glencrest was formed in 2019 by apartment industry veteran John Adair (former head of capital transactions at Prime Residential, one of the largest apartment investors in the Western US) and serial tech entrepreneur Mike Bergelson. We would like to add 2 – 3 critical team members in 2023 to help us keep growing and working to achieve our mission. Role summary The Data Hacker / Analyst will be responsible for building and refining systems to retrieve and analyze data from external and internal sources to improve our investment and operations outcomes. This role partners with colleagues in acquisitions, asset management, investor relations and corporate admin to ensure that these functions operate efficiently and can make effective, data-driven decisions. This role will provide the Data Hacker / Analyst with exposure to all aspects of the multifamily investment business, from determining which markets we should target to identifying trends and benchmarks in the operations of existing assets that others might not see. Additionally, the Data Hacker / Analyst can choose to engage as actively as desired on the development and evolution of modern software solutions that our team and potentially even residents will use to improve their Glencrest experiences. While much of the work can be done remotely, commuting proximity to our downtown San Francisco office (ideally spending 2 - 3 days a week in the office) is a required. Detailed description of responsibilities The Data Hacker / Analyst will be the go-to resource at Glencrest for creating standard reports, models, one-off analyses and accessing third party data to help each of our core functions operate efficiently. Additionally, we have begun creating custom software solutions (using third-party developers) to support our internal workflow and expect to do a lot more of this. The Data Hacker / Analyst may choose to play a key role in guiding the development of future software development projects (not required). Over time, we expect the needs of this function to grow beyond the capacity of a single person so we will look to build the team with internal and external (contractor / vendor) resources. The position will support each of the following functions (sample projects included): Asset management Standard reporting - we have a host of reports that support internal and external decision-making and commitments, e.g., weekly marketing, staff and operations reports, quarterly lender reports, etc. We’d like to automate the creation and distribution of these processes to the extent possible. Additionally, we’d like to enhance the way we track capital expenditures at the property level and across the portfolio; this is an area that offers significant opportunity for creativity with tangible benefits to our business. Management reporting - we review our portfolio on a quarterly basis and have a first-version package of reports that we use to support this process. We’d like to evolve our reporting package to simplify the process each quarter and augment what’s shared with the team. Over time, we’d like to create dashboards for internal and external data sharing, e.g., for property financial performance and water / energy consumption. Resident experience - help develop or license passive data collection and surveys to gather resident experience data. Create benchmarks, reports and dashboards to help our team drive improved outcomes. Property marketing - help improve our ability to collect and analyze data to support optimization of marketing spend per signed lease. Benchmarking - as our portfolio grows, we have the ability to identify operational trends to support annual budgeting and ongoing asset management. Acquisitions Underwriting - we currently use a second-generation underwriting model. This needs to be iteratively improved to ensure flexibility while reducing the risk of mistakes. Benchmarking - we would like to incorporate internally-generated and externally-accessed operational, transactional and demographic data for target properties. Ideally these data would be accessible from within the underwriting model over time. Team effectiveness - build and / or test and, ultimately, license and integrate software solutions that support the acquisitions process. Investor relations Semi-annual reports - we offer standardized reports to our investors in July and January to keep them informed of the performance of their investments. This process is semi-automated now but can benefit from further refinement over time. Custom reports - our goal is to provide a top-decile investor experience. To that end, we’d like to offer investors useful ways to view investment performance, e.g., through customized portfolio returns. Data feeds - we’d like to automate data feeds into investment management platforms used by investment advisors whose clients invest with us. Admin Employee reporting - we aspire to be a top employer in the real estate investment industry. To do so, we need to measure our progress in key areas such as employee engagement and sentiment on an ongoing basis. Expense reimbursement workflow - our team’s expense reimbursement requirements are not simple as we bill certain expenses back to properties we own, e.g., those related to our due diligence or asset management processes. Currently this process is somewhat manual and could be improved. Key attributes Possesses unquestionable integrity Passionate about building a long-term career in the multifamily industry Interpersonally savvy; easily passes the “Pittsburgh airport test” Action oriented and averse to making excuses Able to prioritize, stay organized and meet critical deadlines Hard working; can be counted on to exceed goals successfully Extremely responsive except when they’re off the grid Cool under pressure and channels frustrations productively (and / or humorously) Able to think critically and solve problems logically Willing to do the job no one else wants to Takes pride in knowing an absurd number of Excel keyboard shortcuts and functions Able to balance the demands of a fast-paced career with those of life beyond work Deeply empathic and respectful of those we interact with on a daily basis Handles direct feedback well and uses it to learn and evolve Job experience and education requirements 3-7 years of work experience in a fast-paced, data-oriented environment Exceptional analytical skills Varsity-level Excel and / or Google Sheets experience Yardi or other property management software experience is a plus Bachelor’s or advanced degrees are preferred but not required Writes and speaks English extremely well Real estate experience is preferred but not required Compensation Base and bonus are competitive with the management consulting, private equity and real estate industries.

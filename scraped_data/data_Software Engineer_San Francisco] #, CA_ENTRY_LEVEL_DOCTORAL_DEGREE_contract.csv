You must create an Indeed account before continuing to the company website to apply Apply on company site save-icon Job details Job Type Full-time Contract Overview STC supports the US Army's Technology Development Directorate (TDD) located at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA. Much of this support involves the development and application of modeling and simulation tools for rotorcraft aerodynamics and structural dynamics in Army acquisition-related programs such as Future Vertical Lift. These modeling and simulation activities aim to improve performance, reduce risk, and enhance safety for Army rotorcraft. The Army’s primary computational fluid dynamics tool for high-fidelity rotary-wing aeromechanics simulations is called “Helios.” The Helios software consists of a number of multi-disciplinary computational modules that connect through a lightweight and object-oriented Python language infrastructure. Helios can analyze multiple-rotor, multiple-rotor and fuselage combinations with intended analysis applications for new Army rotorcraft acquisition activities that are part of the Army’s Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. Responsibilities The Helios development plan calls for annual software releases with major upgrades and improvements to individual software modules with each new release. This position requires the formulation, development, and testing of new and improved software modules for Helios. These new software improvements will involve new and improved, solution algorithms for existing flow solvers, new gridding strategies and flow solvers, new modeling capabilities such as rotorcraft maneuver, and new strategies for improved parallel scalability. This requirement requires creativity and vision for developing, implementing, and testing new capabilities that are targeted for future Helios software releases. Qualifications The successful candidate should have substantial experience and expertise in the development and application of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics software and high-performance parallel computing. Experience in multi-disciplinary fluid and structural dynamics problems related to rotorcraft is also a plus. M.S. degree in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering is required, Ph.D. is preferred. Candidate must be a U.S. Citizen or Green Card holder.

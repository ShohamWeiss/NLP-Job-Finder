As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity. In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco’s Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Observability business. About the Role The goal of full stack observability (FSO) is to provide customers end-to-end visibility into infrastructure (cloud or native), applications, networks, the Internet, and everything in between. With ThousandEyes' unprecedented visibility into application and internet performance, we can help root cause issues that are impacting business-critical experiences and give customers confidence in their ability to solve issues and deliver stellar experiences. As a part of this team, you will build an Open Telemetry platform for sharing fine-grained telemetry data to customers and partners as well as ingesting data and configurations into the ThousandEyes platform. You will contribute to building robust and scalable data pipelines, visualizations, and microservices that support business workflows. You will make sure systems are operational and adhere to strict SLAs. Minimum Qualifications 15+ years of software development experience Expert-level understanding of object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc. Ability to articulate design choices based on an expert understanding of the product, technology, and ROI Able to handle ambiguity, scope work accurately and provide reliable estimates for project milestones and completion Strong Computer Science fundamentals and object-oriented design skills Involvement in building large-scale real-time streaming pipelines using Kafka, Flink, or Spark Exceptional team collaboration and communication skills An eye for proactively identifying and resolving risks and issues in production systems Experience working in a fast-paced development environment Ability to mentor peers or other members of the team Bachelor degree in Computer Science or similar Preferred Qualifications Knowledge and use of Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP) Understanding of network protocols Ability to contribute knowledge sharing within the professional community with technical blogs or publications Engineering at ThousandEyes At ThousandEyes, we use cutting-edge technologies and innovative techniques to study and visualize networks on a global scale.ThousandEyes engineers are focused on continuous improvement of our product, our codebase, our knowledge, and our skills.

Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colourful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us. We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

Apply now Apply now save-icon Job details Salary $164,200 - $241,700 a year Job Type Full-time Who We Are The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see what's not ordinarily possible, and the ability to collect intelligence from vantage points as diverse and global as the Internet. As organizations depend on cloud services, the Internet has become their defacto network connecting cloud applications to users. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform is like a 'Google maps of the Internet', providing the only collectively powered view of digital experiences end-to-end. We enable our customers made up of the world's largest and fastest-growing brands, to identify problems before they impact revenue, brand reputation, or employee productivity.

For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process. U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program. Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid. Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colourful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us. We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

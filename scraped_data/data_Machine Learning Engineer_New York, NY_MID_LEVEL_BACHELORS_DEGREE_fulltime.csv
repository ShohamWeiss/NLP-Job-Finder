The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design. At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it. We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments. This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

From our earliest days, we pioneered the use of predictive modeling to individually personalize credit card offers, turning the entire industry on its head. As we’ve grown bigger, we’ve found more and more ways to use technology and face-to-face conversations to understand the human problems associated with money and finances. In the Consumer Bank, we’ve combined this human-centered approach with our heritage of data-driven decision making to design, build and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We’ve challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money. Are you passionate about improving the way people interact with their money? Are you driven by the delight you bring to customers? Do you keep asking, “why,” until you hit the root? It’s common to fall in love with solutions, but have you ever fallen in love with the problem? Do you have an opinion on whether shipping is more important than perfection? Do you have a healthy dose of skepticism for the impossible? If you’re nodding your head, then we want you! As a Product Manager focusing on our Consumer Bank products, you’ll be joining a passionate team of product managers, designers, engineers, data scientists, and analysts working to redefine how millions of customers interact with their money.

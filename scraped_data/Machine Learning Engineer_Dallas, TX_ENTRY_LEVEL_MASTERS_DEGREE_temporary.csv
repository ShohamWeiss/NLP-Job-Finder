Our programs equip you with the knowledge and training you need to play a valuable role on your team and establish a long-term career here. At Citi, we value internal mobility, and career growth is not a question of if, but when. Citi’s Personal Banking & Wealth Management Technology Analyst Program (PBWMT) is seeking students for the software development track of its Summer Analyst program. These positions are based in Dallas (Texas), and Jacksonville (Florida) for students with targeted graduation dates between December 2023 and May 2024. The Summer Analyst program starts in June and runs for 10 weeks. The best way to think about PBWMT is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day. We provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed. Starting in June, the PWBMT Summer Analyst Program provides a 10-week immersive experience in one of our PBWMT teams. There are three tracks within this program: Software Development (iOS, Android, Angular, Java) Data & Analytics (Data Engineer, Machine Learning & Visualization) Analyst (Project Management, Product Management & More) Each track focuses on different skillsets, has its own application/interview process, and leads to full-time opportunities. All Summer Analysts will receive training, networking, and mentoring opportunities to help build the necessary skills for future success. Roles are assigned based on their skills and interests, as well as business needs. Your time here will look something like this… As part of the Software Development track, you’d be placed in an Agile development team, building features for the Citi Mobile and Citibank Online applications that are used by millions of customers. Our teams operate in four-week sprints and are organized around a set of features that they own. While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories. Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry iOS: Swift, Xcode Android: Java, Android Studio, Kotlin Web: Angular (version 9), TypeScript While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas. Interns in this track will be considered for full-time Software Development offers after graduation, with the freedom to again choose between the four roles above. Over time, you would have the option to become a full-stack developer or specialize.

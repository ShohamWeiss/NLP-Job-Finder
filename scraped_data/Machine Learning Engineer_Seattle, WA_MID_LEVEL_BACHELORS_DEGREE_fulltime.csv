That would be hard. Yet, for engineers working on modern robotics systems (such as self-driving cars or drones), that’s an analogous reality. These engineers often struggle to make informed decisions about their robots when things aren’t working correctly, and have to hack together solutions in-house. We're building a platform to ingest, search and analyze the vast amounts of data produced by robots. Our platform ingests data from a wide range of devices (such as cameras, lidars, radars, batteries, motors, and more), and then allows engineers to analyze and transform it. It’s AI. It's robotics. It’s autonomous systems. It’s the future. And it’s going to be huge. Join us! We’re looking for a principal or senior-level backend engineer to join our founding team as a technical lead. In this role, you will be responsible for designing groundbreaking new data infrastructure to efficiently ingest and process vast amounts of sensor data. We expect you to have prior experience building robust data pipelines that can support tasks such as annotation, machine learning, data analysis and search. TYPICAL QUALIFICATIONS BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience At least 5 years of full-time experience Expertise in designing, building, and operating large-scale data infrastructure for companies building robots or autonomous systems. Strong database fundamentals including SQL/NoSQL(e.g. DynamoDB, Redshift) Experience with vector search technologies, query engines and distributed services Experience with several modern programming languages (e.g. Python, Java, C++, Rust, Golang) Experience with ETL workflows and MapReduce-style pipelines Experience with cloud services (e.g. AWS), and infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g. Terraform, CDK) Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Airflow or similar technologies Experience building backend infrastructure for machine learning platforms is a plus Experience with robotics data (e.g. ROS, PX4) and multi-modal sensor data is a plus ABOUT US We are a small but mighty (and growing) group with a mission to help the industry build better robots and bring them to market faster. Our founding team is made up of experts in robotics, machine learning, computer vision and more. In past lives—we were founding engineers on the Amazon Prime Air team, led autonomy and simulation initiatives at Amazon Robotics, and implemented machine learning solutions from AWS into numerous Fortune 500 companies. We also count the Paul Allen Institute for AI as a co-founder, one of the world’s leading A.I. research institutions. WHY JOIN BCG forecasts that the global robotics market will climb from $25 billion in 2021 to upwards of $260 billion by 2030. McKinsey forecasts that the global shared autonomous-driving market alone will be roughly $1.6 trillion by 2030. By any measure—the robotics industry is going to be huge—with the majority of that growth coming in the next 5-10 years. But what's clear is that the industry doesn’t have the tools to facilitate that growth. As a seed-funded stealth startup, we also have several unique benefits that you can’t really get anywhere else: Personal impact — The opportunity to build something from the ground up and define a new product. Founding title — You will be one of our first hires. For the rest of our days, no matter how many thousands of people join after you, you will always have that honor and distinction. Early stage equity — Early stage risk comes with early stage equity for you. And none of us would be here if we didn’t think that our company will create tremendous value over time. Access to unique learning opportunities — With the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) as a co-founder, our team gets access to numerous talks by leading AI researchers/paper authors, access to knowledge sharing amongst the community of hundreds of engineers that work for AI2 companies, and much more.

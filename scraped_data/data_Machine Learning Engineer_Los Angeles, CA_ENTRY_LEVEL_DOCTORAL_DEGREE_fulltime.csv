Researchers at the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem group at JPL, and international partners have recently designed a global Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) based on the power of big data from space technology and artificial intelligence (AI) for climate smart forest restoration and carbon management. CMS is focused on providing precise science-based geospatial data products on carbon stocks and annual emissions and removals at the national and jurisdictional levels to empower decision makers for climate mitigation policies. In its initial phase, our team will integrate a series of optical and microwave satellite (including upcoming NISAR and BIOMASS) imagery with airborne and satellite (GEDI, ICESAT-2) lidar measurements of forest structure and conventional ground-based forest inventory data to map and monitor changes of forest structure and biomass globally and attribute the changes to land use activities and environmental effects. The selected candidates will work with a team of scientists to conduct original research by using machine learning algorithms and process-based models to develop regional and global products and improve our understanding of drivers of carbon stock changes across a variety of ecosystems. The selected candidates may work on two distinct tasks: 1. to map forest disturbance (land use, logging, and tree mortality), fire fuel loads, and biomass carbon change across temperate forests (e.g. western US), and 2. to quantify biomass loss and gain from land use activities (deforestation, degradation), and forest regeneration (e.g. secondary forests) in humid tropical ecosystems (e.g. Amazon and Congo Basins). These tasks will help improve the quantification of global carbon cycle as a result of human and climate-induced changes and better understand the short-term and long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change. The candidates are required to lead one task, perform the analysis, document all algorithms and codes developed for data processing, analysis, science product generation, and lead peer-reviewed publications. The candidates must have a PhD in one of the following areas: remote sensing, computer science, environmental science and engineering, mathematics/statistics with relevant experience in forest ecology and geography. Required qualifications include experience in quantitative analysis of geospatial data, machine learning algorithms, and time series analysis. Candidates with relatively advanced knowledge of lidar and radar remote sensing techniques and particularly in forest applications are preferred. Successful candidates must also have strong programming skills in a scientific languages (e.g. python, MATHLAB, R) and experience in statistical analysis. Applicants should have demonstrated quantitative and computational skills, a successful publication record, and the ability to work in an interdisciplinary research environment. The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature. Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.

The Astrophysics and Spaces Science section of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) invites applications for one or two postdoc positions in the science analysis of the flagship astrophysics missions. High-contrast imaging of exoplanets from space will enable the search for habitable worlds in our interstellar neighborhood and the characterization of their environments. The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has recommended, as a future flagship astrophysics mission, a 6-m space telescope capable of imaging Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of many nearby stars. The architectural choices of the mission that will best achieve this scientific endeavor, such as the wavelength range, sensitivity, and technologies of starlight suppression, are left open for further study. To this end, simulations of plausible atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets and solutions to the inverse problem (i.e., from the spectra to the states of the atmosphere) will help constrain the requirements for spectroscopy. Such requirements would feed into improving the yield analyses of the flagship mission, which would benefit from a figure of merit that incorporates the science value of spectroscopy and characterization. Responsibilities The successful candidate will work on the timely and rich problems associated with the science analysis of flagship astrophysics missions, such as those aforementioned. The postdoc will work at the intersection of exoplanet science and space exploration, and is expected to quantitively analyze the spectral capabilities of direct-imaging exoplanet mission concepts, using methods such as spectral retrievals, information content analysis, and science yield modeling. The postdoc is also encouraged to develop innovative methods, for example, those using machine learning methods or hierarchical Bayesian analysis, to improve the ability to predict and quantify the science yield of future exoplanet missions. The postdoc will also have the support to interact broadly with astrophysicists, planetary scientists, technologists, and engineers at both JPL and Caltech, and will fully benefit from the intellectual environment in both institutions. Qualifications: Applicants with strong motivation and experience in conducting spectral retrieval analysis and science yield estimates for space missions are encouraged to apply. Relevant experience includes spectral retrieval analysis in exoplanets and other subfields of astrophysics, planetary science, and Earth science; Monte Carlo mission simulations of the science yield of future missions, including instrument performance modeling; as well as relevant data-intensive studies in astronomy. Demonstrated experience in working in a multidisciplinary environment is a plus. Scientists and technologists who are from minority groups underrepresented in astronomy are strongly encouraged to apply. A Ph.D. degree in Astronomy or a related field is required. The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publication in literature. Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Applicants should submit a CV including a publication list, representative publications, and a cover letter that describes research experience and achievements, future research interests, as well as how the candidate would support diversity and inclusion at JPL. Applications should be submitted via the JPL Career Website. In addition, applicants should also arrange for three letters of reference.

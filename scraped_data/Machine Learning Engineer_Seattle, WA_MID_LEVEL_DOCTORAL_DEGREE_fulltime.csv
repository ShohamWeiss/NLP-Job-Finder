That would be hard. Yet, for engineers working on modern robotics systems (such as self-driving cars or drones), that’s an analogous reality. These engineers often struggle to make informed decisions about their robots when things aren’t working correctly, and have to hack together solutions in-house. We're building a platform to ingest, search and analyze the vast amounts of data produced by robots. Our platform ingests data from a wide range of devices (such as cameras, lidars, radars, batteries, motors, and more), and then allows engineers to analyze and transform it. It’s AI. It's robotics. It’s autonomous systems. It’s the future. And it’s going to be huge. Join us! We’re looking for a principal or senior-level backend engineer to join our founding team as a technical lead. In this role, you will be responsible for designing groundbreaking new data infrastructure to efficiently ingest and process vast amounts of sensor data. We expect you to have prior experience building robust data pipelines that can support tasks such as annotation, machine learning, data analysis and search. TYPICAL QUALIFICATIONS BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience At least 5 years of full-time experience Expertise in designing, building, and operating large-scale data infrastructure for companies building robots or autonomous systems. Strong database fundamentals including SQL/NoSQL(e.g. DynamoDB, Redshift) Experience with vector search technologies, query engines and distributed services Experience with several modern programming languages (e.g. Python, Java, C++, Rust, Golang) Experience with ETL workflows and MapReduce-style pipelines Experience with cloud services (e.g. AWS), and infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g. Terraform, CDK) Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Airflow or similar technologies Experience building backend infrastructure for machine learning platforms is a plus Experience with robotics data (e.g. ROS, PX4) and multi-modal sensor data is a plus ABOUT US We are a small but mighty (and growing) group with a mission to help the industry build better robots and bring them to market faster. Our founding team is made up of experts in robotics, machine learning, computer vision and more. In past lives—we were founding engineers on the Amazon Prime Air team, led autonomy and simulation initiatives at Amazon Robotics, and implemented machine learning solutions from AWS into numerous Fortune 500 companies. We also count the Paul Allen Institute for AI as a co-founder, one of the world’s leading A.I. research institutions. WHY JOIN BCG forecasts that the global robotics market will climb from $25 billion in 2021 to upwards of $260 billion by 2030. McKinsey forecasts that the global shared autonomous-driving market alone will be roughly $1.6 trillion by 2030. By any measure—the robotics industry is going to be huge—with the majority of that growth coming in the next 5-10 years. But what's clear is that the industry doesn’t have the tools to facilitate that growth. As a seed-funded stealth startup, we also have several unique benefits that you can’t really get anywhere else: Personal impact — The opportunity to build something from the ground up and define a new product. Founding title — You will be one of our first hires. For the rest of our days, no matter how many thousands of people join after you, you will always have that honor and distinction. Early stage equity — Early stage risk comes with early stage equity for you. And none of us would be here if we didn’t think that our company will create tremendous value over time. Access to unique learning opportunities — With the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) as a co-founder, our team gets access to numerous talks by leading AI researchers/paper authors, access to knowledge sharing amongst the community of hundreds of engineers that work for AI2 companies, and much more.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. The Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington educates tomorrow’s innovators, conducts cutting-edge research in the core and emerging areas of the field, and leads a broad range of multi-disciplinary initiatives that demonstrate the transformative power of computing. Consistently ranked among the top computer science programs in the nation, the Allen School is widely recognized for the excellence and impact of our research and teaching across the region and around the globe. As a leader in efforts to broaden participation in computing, we are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in our program and in our field. Members of the Allen School actively work to cultivate a welcoming community in which students, faculty, and staff with diverse backgrounds, identities, and experiences can thrive. The Allen School occupies two spectacular buildings — the Paul G. Allen Center and the adjacent Bill & Melinda Gates Center — located at the heart of the UW campus in Seattle. The Allen School has two outstanding opportunities for a full-time Technical Applications Lead . The Technical Applications Lead (Research Scientist/Engineer 4) supports research being conducted by faculty and graduate students in the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology. This position will support the Transportation Data Equity Initiative project sponsored by the USDOT ITS4US program. This innovative data infrastructure project, with a broad partnership among state departments of transportation, transportation service providers, industry and community partners, seeks to enable mobility equity by creating an interoperable, shared data infrastructure to fill in gaps in current transportation data and ultimately, provide travelers needed information they can trust. Detailed, accurate data about pedestrian networks, travel environments (transit facilities, etc.) and on-demand travel services is crucial for any trip planner, trip concierge, wayfinding, or exploratory mobile application, in particular applications and mobile experiences serving the needs of people with disabilities, older adults, veterans, suburban and rural populations. The massive breadth of this project will be achieved through an accelerated timeline on currently planned technology innovations led by the DOT’s in each state, WA, OR and MD. This position will report to the Director, Taskar Center for Accessible Technology. RESPONSIBILITIES Working independently with occasional oversight, duties will include the following: Provide scientific and project leadership in the role of Technical Applications Lead. Complete and manage ongoing University required elements of the Transportation Data Equity Initiative (TDEI) grant, such as Review Board (IRB) requirements and USDOT requirements. The person in this role is ultimately responsible for the technical applications internal to the interoperable data infrastructure. The actual creation of the TDEI infrastructure entails the extraction of specific data elements from various systems and raw data files into a database. Before being loaded into this database, automated data transformations, integrations and vetting will be required. This involves original research work in the area of graph and network homology in complex transportation layers. Additionally, the research output will require changing the formats of certain elements to conform to a standard, making all iterations of an element have the same data type and size. Importantly the research objectives of this work is to identify the algorithms that adequate summarize certain elements, graph features and graph topologies. Additionally, the role of Technical Applications Lead is responsible for researching best practices and developing one instance of underlying application data tools that interface with data consumers and producers, specifically where analysis is required for the creation of data, or responding to complex queries against the database. The person in this role is also responsible for studying the best mechanisms to provide TDEI data tenants with the ability to store, reuse and modify data. Serve as primary liaison with partners both virtually and in person. Travel to partner communities and workshops; assist in the operation of community engagement workshops. Provide ongoing automation for quality control, vetting, security and privacy for data collection and collation. Resolve deployment and evaluation issues as discovered. Use advanced project planning techniques aligned with the rest of the leading team for the project to manage project, evaluate project status, and interface with customer/grant sponsor. Analyze and compiling results for academic publication and dissemination to partner organizations. Assist in the development of future grant proposals.

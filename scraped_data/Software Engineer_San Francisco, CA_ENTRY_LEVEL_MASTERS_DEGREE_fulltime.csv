You must create an Indeed account before continuing to the company website to apply Apply on company site save-icon Job details Salary $187,000 - $233,000 a year Job Type Full-time Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World’s Most Experienced Driver™—to improve everyone's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our fully autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 20 billion miles of simulation testing. At Waymo, we are mission-driven and believe deeply in the opportunity of autonomous driving technology to improve mobility and make people's lives better. We are united by purpose and responsibility (for our employees and riders alike). We are looking for kind, committed, employees who have integrity, dream big, work together as one team and create a sense of belonging for one another that is the foundation of our culture. We want each team member to feel welcomed and included in every step of our exciting journey. The Simulation Organization enables Waymo to simulate and analyze millions of miles of driving every day. We can recreate, modify, and amplify our real-world experience - or generate entirely new situations from scratch. We work with teams across Waymo, enabling the rapid iterations in advancing self-driving technology. Our work was recently featured in The Atlantic - ""Inside Waymo's Secret World for training Self-Driving Cars"". As powerful as this system is, however, there are still many open problems to solve and much work ahead of us. Role Description As a Software Engineer on the Driver Understanding and Evaluation team, you will work to understand and measure the performance and safety of our Waymo Driver, which is key to unlocking scale. Large scale experimentation and data driven decision making in autonomous driving has unique challenges - the long tail behavior matters more than the average case. Discovering and recreating the long tail is hard, and experimentation via real-world driving does not scale. We are building Machine Learning models that represent and understand the world we drive in, and executing experimentation via large-scale realistic simulation. If you have a background in working on complex high-quality systems, and enjoy Machine Learning, Data Mining, experimentation and metric design, we’d like to meet you!

This vision is relevant because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies. We want to help them make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially. We believe that doing so will be transformational to their lives and their long-term future. About Wealthfront Engineering At Wealthfront, engineering is the largest group with over 50% of the employees. Hence engineering culture permeates throughout the organization. You will work with and learn from invigorating colleagues who come from diverse backgrounds. Very few had a finance background before starting at Wealthfront. Given our size - about 240 employees in total and about 125 employees in Engineering, you have the ability to have an outsized impact, regardless of your industry tenure. Our Banking system was designed and first developed by an engineer 3 years out of college. The Linking platform was developed by engineers with up to 6 years industry experience. When you start we will pair you up with a mentor who will guide you for as long as you want. Our culture is optimized for continued learning and automation. At Wealthfront we are builder/operators: engineers have the dual responsibility to build the system and operate the system in production, dealing with problems as they occur. This provides you direct feedback on how your code performs in production. We preach and practice automation. As an engineer, you are expected to automate any toil you encounter. No permissions required, no prioritizations expected, no questions asked. We are disciples of quality and we don’t have a separate QA organization. Engineers are expected to write automated test cases that build upon the existing test cases. For example, our investing algorithms have a dedicated suite of tests that runs full trading day simulations on a representative sample of real accounts. This testing framework allows us to test any code change against historical scenarios. If our culture of learning, the potential to have a huge impact, and our focus on quality resonates with you, then we want you! Note: This role has the option to be based in Palo Alto CA, Boston MA, or remote (U.S) About the Role: We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance. You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems. Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team. About You: You have 1-3 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay). You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment. While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate. Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger). You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field. Once you join, Wealthfront will: Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team Estimated annual salary range: $142,000 - $169,000 USD plus Equity.

About Wealthfront Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $27 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

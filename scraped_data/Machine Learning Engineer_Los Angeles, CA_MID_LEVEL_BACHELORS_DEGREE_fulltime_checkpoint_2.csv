What you'll do : You’ll lead and mentor a team of engineers in the design and development of (at first) novel drones that fly over water in ground effect, and (later) those that operate with extreme efficiency in all capacities and situations. You'll help to grow that team over time with diverse top tier talent that you help bring on board to fill roles in mechanical, robotics, electrical, powertrain, aerodynamics, and software engineering. You’ll take the initiative for technical leadership on both small-scale prototypes and full scale versions, and be a positive hands-on contributor to the building and testing of any hardware. You’ll have a lot of responsibility for setting (and meeting!) specific and ambitious engineering requirements for a full craft, and on down into systems and sub-systems – you'll educate your collaborators on the why and the how, as well as learning from your team. You’ll work directly with the CEO on macro and micro facets of the engineering as well as some aspects of the business, and be a comfortable communicator to internal and external stakeholders alike. You’ll pro-actively help to project manage the engineering progress towards specific milestones, on time and on budget, adhering to best practices and industry standards for quality and safety. You’ll set the tone. Who you are : You love airplanes. Experience Essential! Several (>5 preferred) years in an industry setting working on design and/or development of flying machines, from the conceptual through to real hardware (experience on the powertrain side also valued). We definitely value direct experience with electric/electrified aircraft, but you'd at least have the enthusiasm to be a very fast learner. Ideally you also have direct personal experience in – and passion for - prototyping and rapid incremental testing and development of full systems at the simulation, benchtop and small/RC scale. You have had direct reports and have experience managing engineers to successful completion of impressive milestones – those who have worked under you will have good things to say about that time if we ask them. Your approach to work You feel comfortable working in grey areas and can take intelligent action without all the information being available, but you can justify with the best numbers you can run in the moment Vibrant curiosity; you take a keen interest in the product and the tools and processes you use, to continually improve the work of the whole company and deepen your own knowledge and capability. Extremely high levels of self-motivation – this is a small team that requires everyone to take the initiative even if it’s outside their comfort zone. You care about quality and safety in everything you do You have the demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively and with empathy with colleagues, suppliers, and other stakeholders from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds. Education Bachelors or higher degree in aerospace/aeronautical, mechanical, electrical engineering or a related field.

Be available for full time work on-site in Carson, Los Angeles (some remote work flexibility may be available once you are up and running but this is primarily in-person) Our process After screening, we'll do an initial call with the hiring manager. If promising, you would be invited to chat to the rest of the team and present some prior project work, and we’ll do our best to show you why this is going to be a really, really impactful thing for you to do with your talent. This will be a deep dive, and may require more than one session. If still successful, you'd be invited to our facility for a last stage. Who We Are Seaflight is a young company on a mission to accelerate an electric and equitable future for flight. And we’re doing it with friendly robots! We design, build, test and manufacture uncrewed (drone) electric flying machines to deliver cargo with world-beating aerodynamic efficiency. We’re a Y Combinator (S22) startup that’s venture-backed by top-tier VCs, with R&D funding from the government too. We’re based in sunny South Bay Los Angeles, not too far from the beaches. The company is first developing remote-piloted wingships that will fly in ground effect to offer a highly efficient, extremely low-cost, quick-to-market way to establish logistics service in some of the world’s most difficult-to-serve markets. Taking advantage of several proprietary, cutting-edge technologies we’re developing to do this, a much broader range of applications is on the horizon as we aim to be a global leader in middle mile drone capability as well as a high-value developer of key tech for all forms of electric flight. We're showing it’s possible now to cut costs, cut emissions, cut time, and cut worries with electric flight that is focused on extreme efficiency, not crazy complexity. We celebrate differences and are committed to a diverse workplace that fosters inclusion for employees from different backgrounds and experiences.

Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam (Weight: 100%) Candidates self-certifying meeting the Minimum Qualifications will be invited to participate in the online Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam. Candidates will be sent a web link via email that will allow them to take the online Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam that is designed to measure basic analytical and technical abilities associated with the target job, which may include but not be limited to: Knowledge of physical (e.g., Linux) and virtual servers (e.g., VMware) Knowledge of various software applications (e.g., CMIS-Primavera) Knowledge of antivirus software (e.g., McAfee) Knowledge of systems security & ability to implement system security protocols Knowledge of storage technologies and backup systems (e.g., NetApp) Knowledge of various operating systems (e.g., Windows 7 XP) Ability to configure multifunction devices Ability to document developed procedures and protocols Knowledge of active directory Ability to troubleshoot server, storage and network connectivity problems Analytical thinking This computer-administered test can be taken at home or at a time and location of one’s convenience, but only within a two-week period specified on the test notification. Candidates must have access to a computer and reliable internet connection to participate in this exam. The test consists of 25 questions and it must be completed within 60 minutes. Questions are presented one at a time on the computer screen. There is no penalty for guessing. Candidates may not return to questions presented earlier in the exam; they can only move forward. A passing score must be attained on this test in order to continue further in the selection process. Test questions and answers are not available for public inspection or review. Note: A passing score must be achieved on all examination components in order to be placed on the Eligible List. The hiring department may administer additional position-specific procedures to make final hiring decisions. Achieving a passing score in one class does not guarantee placement on eligible lists for the other classes. You must apply to each class for which you would like to be considered. There are different exams for each of the SF Civic Tech specialty areas (Applications, Networks, Security and Systems), and each class (1041, 1042, 1043 and 1044) has a different passing score for each exam. Candidates’ scores on the Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam may also be applied to other announcements involving other job titles, when directed by the Human Resources Director. Score Banking: Scores attained on the Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam will be 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, candidates need not take this test again. Rather, if another announcement you applied to and are deemed qualified for requires the Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam and is held within one year of your Tech Engineer – Systems Core Exam date your score will be automatically applied to that announcement. However, after one year, a candidate has the option to either (a) apply their test score to the other announcement or (b) re-take the test. Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the test and only in association with a candidate’s eligibility for another announcement to which the candidate has applied and is deemed qualified. If a candidate opts to re-test, the re-test score becomes the candidate’s official score since it is the most recent. If a significant modification is made to this exam in the future, the application of “banked” scores may no longer be appropriate. In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three-year period specified above should they apply to another job opportunity where the modified exam is used. Eligible List/Score Report: A confidential eligible list of applicant names that have passed the civil service examination process will be created, and used for certification purposes only. An examination score report will be established, so applicants can view the ranks, final scores and number of eligible candidates. Applicant information, including names of applicants on the eligible list, shall not be made public unless required by law. However, an eligible list shall be made available for public inspection, upon request, once the eligible list is exhausted or expired and referrals resolved. The eligible list/score report resulting from this civil service examination process is subject to change after adoption (e.g., as a result of appeals), as directed by the Human Resources Director or the Civil Service Commission. Upon passing the exam, candidates will be placed on the eligible list for a period of 12 months. To find Departments which use this classification, please see https://sfdhr.org/sites/default/files/documents/Forms-Documents/Position-Counts-by-Job-Codes-and-Department-FY-2021-22.pdf .

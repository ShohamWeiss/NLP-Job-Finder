Model Development team members maintain and improve a suite of models including the Activity Based Model (ABM), Rapid Strategic Model (RSM), Commercial Vehicle Model (CVM), Cross border Model (CBM), and other special market models. Key focus areas include the addition of new features related to emerging technologies, transformative transportation modes, and shared mobility. The Model Development team also supports the Model Application team’s production modeling and analysis efforts. Model Application team members apply the ABM in support of agency priority projects and initiatives including the regional plan, corridor studies, capital improvement projects, member agency development projects and climate action planning efforts. The Application team manages the master transportation network, performs model runs, interprets and analyzes results, and communicates model outputs through a wide range of data and visualization and presentation formats. Key focus areas for these positions include border port of entry planning for the State Route 11/ Otay Mesa East project and Comprehensive Multimodal Corridor Plans. More information about SANDAG transportation modeling can be found at https://www.sandag.org/index.asp?subclassid=119&fuseaction=home.subclasshome Overview of the Modeling Program As a premier multi-modal planning and project implementation agency, SANDAG relies on the quality and capacity of our Transportation, Demographic, Economic, and Land Use Modeling programs. A team of highly skilled professionals support a variety of projects including long-range coordinated transportation, economic, and land use plans, corridor studies, major transit investment studies, infrastructure development studies, and air quality plans. As regional planning needs, travel behavior, and socioeconomic conditions change, the demands and expectations of our modeling program have increased. To meet these challenges, SANDAG has committed the resources necessary to develop and maintain a robust, agile, and integrated modeling infrastructure to support policy development and decision making. SANDAG has developed a nationally recognized and highly sophisticated ABM. As the future transportation system transforms, SANDAG will be updating its ABM, RSM, CVM, and CBM to respond to the impact of emerging transportation technologies, transformative travel modes, and shared mobilities used for regional planning. Job Responsibilities Perform various duties related to the development, maintenance, and improvement of SANDAG’s ABM, RSM, CVM, and CBM. Perform research and participate in the development of modeling features related to emerging transportation technologies, transformative modes, and shared mobilities. Assist with the development and maintenance of custom software applications to support transportation modeling. Ensure transportation modeling tools and analytical capabilities are credible and effective for policy analysis; participate in quality assurance and quality control processes. Maintain GIS networks of current and future roadway, transit, and active transportation projects. Analyze and understand model run forecasts including performance metrics and mapping, travel behavior and impacts. Perform analysis of large data sets and translate findings into digestible information to help inform various agency projects. Research, collect, and compile data; ensure accuracy of information; maintain databases, and documentation. Develop and prepare transportation model data visualizations. Participate in and support project matrix teams assembled for transportation modeling analysis required for long-range regional plans and highway and transit investment studies. Participate in the integration of transportation and land use models; coordinate with economic and demographic research staff to determine data interactions. Coordinate with the Data Solutions team to maintain transportation databases; ensure current and accurate traffic and passenger count data are being used. Assist with the preparation and presentation of written, oral, and visual reports for dissemination to policy and stakeholder committees, member agencies, community groups, private organizations, and members of the public. Typical Qualifications A bachelor’s degree in transportation modeling, computer science, mathematics, statistics, engineering, or a related field; one to three years of career development that include the types of career experience listed below. Knowledge of the principles and practices of travel demand modeling and forecasting; experience in development and/or the application of activity-based models is desirable. Experience programming in languages such as Java, Python, R, and SQL; experience developing and maintaining custom software applications to support modeling functions. Experience using modeling software such as EMME to support large, complex model development and applications projects. Experience using geographic information system software such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS. Experience with big/passive data and applications in travel demand modeling is preferable; research and/or modeling autonomous vehicles, transformative modes, and shared mobilities are desirable. Experience with data acquisition, compilation, and quality assurance/quality control methods; experience with relational databases such as SQL Server is desirable. Experience with ESRI software to include feature creation, scripting, mapping, and spatial analytics; knowledge of transportation network coding principals is preferable. Experience with data visualization tools such as Power BI, Plotly, or Esri Experience Builder. Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to maintain a high level of accuracy.

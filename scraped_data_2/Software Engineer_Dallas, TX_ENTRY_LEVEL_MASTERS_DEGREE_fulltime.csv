The Summer Analyst program starts in June and runs for 10 weeks. The best way to think about PBWMT is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day. We provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed. Starting in June, the PWBMT Summer Analyst Program provides a 10-week immersive experience in one of our PBWMT teams. There are three tracks within this program: Software Development (iOS, Android, Angular, Java) Data & Analytics (Data Engineer, Machine Learning & Visualization) Analyst (Project Management, Product Management & More) Each track focuses on different skillsets, has its own application/interview process, and leads to full-time opportunities. All Summer Analysts will receive training, networking, and mentoring opportunities to help build the necessary skills for future success. Roles are assigned based on their skills and interests, as well as business needs. Your time here will look something like this… As part of the Software Development track, you’d be placed in an Agile development team, building features for the Citi Mobile and Citibank Online applications that are used by millions of customers. Our teams operate in four-week sprints and are organized around a set of features that they own. While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories. Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry iOS: Swift, Xcode Android: Java, Android Studio, Kotlin Web: Angular (version 9), TypeScript While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas. Interns in this track will be considered for full-time Software Development offers after graduation, with the freedom to again choose between the four roles above. Over time, you would have the option to become a full-stack developer or specialize. We want to hear from you if… • You are pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in any discipline: • Preferred disciplines include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Development or a related field You have a GPA of 3.0 or above (preferred) You have an interest working in a high tech global technology environment and have a fundamental understanding of technologies, including by not limited to programing languages (with Java, Mobile or Web development), application development, or basic concepts of relational databases. You will not require sponsorship for U.S. work authorization now or anytime in the future. Who we think will be a great fit… A dedication to learning and a true passion for the business are vital. As industries all over the globe continue to restructure and grow, we are hiring professionals who have a global perspective on the future of banking and want to make an impact. We value diversity and so do you.

At Sparx you will work with clients on projects involving everything from embedded microcontrollers, to media and image processing, to Bluetooth and TCP communications, to server-side database, web, and mobile app development. You will use a variety of languages from C to VHDL to Scala to C# .NET to Objective-C, all the way up the stack with languages such as JavaScript and Kotlin and Swift, often switching between them on a daily basis. As such, you should have a proven track record of being able to pick up new languages and technologies, be multi-faceted in your skillset and interests, and preferably have some history of ""tinkering"" in your spare time. We operate across many fields such as oil and gas, medical, robotics, industrial automation and consumer products. You will be exposed to many types of technology and have the opportunity to hone your current expertise and learn skills both within and outside of the software engineering spectrum, such as electronics and advanced data analysis. You will be working in small teams with other highly skilled engineers and developers to create products and software services from most every industry. Expect to be constantly challenged as part of an organization that strives to push the technological envelope in delivering innovative solutions to customer problems. Sparx is a casual and highly collaborative work environment. Our relatively small team helps us utilize the best of each player on different projects. Responsibilities Design and implement software of embedded devices and systems from requirements to production and commercial deployment Work directly with engineering peers from all disciplines to create new technologies for multiple industries Communicate and appropriately document engineering designs at all phases of the product lifecycle Requirements Unless you can prove that you are a phenomenal developer through extensive work history, a minimum of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering or similar is required. Experience in the following areas is also preferred: Dedication to proper source control methods Strong problem solving and communication (verbal and written) skills Excellent mathematics skills Experience in testing and troubleshooting Experience interfacing with internal/external customers and vendors Proven working experience in software engineering Experience in hands-on development and troubleshooting on embedded targets Solid programming experience in C or C++ Proven experience in embedded systems design with preemptive, multitasking real-time operating systems Familiarity with software configuration management tools, defect tracking tools, and peer review Excellent knowledge of OS coding techniques, IP protocols, interfaces and hardware subsystems Adequate knowledge of reading schematics and data sheets for components Strong documentation and writing skills At Sparx, we move quickly and work on a wide variety of projects. Our engineers are challenged daily and must be versatile. You may be introduced to a technology stack that you have limited familiarity in, especially those that deal with the fast-paced nature of emerging technologies from machine learning to virtual reality and various modern tools and libraries. Therefore, given the diversity of our projects, we are more concerned with your work ethic and your fit than your experience in any specific technology. You will also be dealing directly with clients, on the front line, so it is important for you to be able to recognize and apply the proper software lifecycle procedures and methodologies in order to help them meet their needs in an efficient and predictable manner. You are someone who recognizes potential pain points in the design of a system, knows how to utilize the best tool for the job, and apply the best estimates when interfacing with the stakeholders. You are not the type to sit on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you what to do next. You are someone who will continue to develop valuable skills such as big-picture prototyping, breaking down large tasks into smaller, testable pieces, and expanding your software capabilities. We seek problem solvers, not problem finders, and we hold our engineers to a high standard of productivity. There are no ""weak links"" at Sparx. In this highly collaborative and engaging environment, you will have the opportunity to work with, and learn from, a talented group of individuals, being exposed to a vast array of different domains and expertise. You will be surrounded by high performers and every member of our team is able to trust each other to get their job done effectively.

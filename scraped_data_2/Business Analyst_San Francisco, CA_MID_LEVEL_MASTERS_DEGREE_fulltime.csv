Departmental Overview About the David and Lucile Packard Foundation The David and Lucile Packard Foundation is where the Program Analyst will work. The Packard Foundation was established in 1964. David and Lucile Packard believed that along with universities, national institutions, community groups, youth agencies, family planning centers, and hospitals, foundations constitute a great American tradition that complements government efforts to focus on society's needs. The foundation's mission is to work with people and communities to create enduring solutions for just societies and a healthy, resilient natural world. Through a recent strategic planning process, the foundation identified three overarching, interdependent goals to guide the Foundation's work: Protect and Restore Our Natural World, Invest in Families and Communities, and Build Just Societies. About the Global Reproductive Health Program The goal of the Global Reproductive Health Initiative (Global RH) is to increase equitable access to quality reproductive health care such that quality information and services are accessible and affordable to all who need them. They focus on supporting grantees' work on essential services such as comprehensive abortion, voluntary contraception, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health. To do this, the Global RH Initiative works strategically across the global system to center the needs of women and young people and foster supportive policy, innovation, learning, and connections that will drive change. They believe that the ability of all people to realize their reproductive health and rights is vital to achieving gender equity. Anchoring this vision are the values for how they work as a team and support their grantee partners - with humility, creativity, and care. The Global RH Initiative sits within the Packard Foundation's goal to ""Build Just Societies"", which are key to supporting families and communities and protecting our natural world. When the institutions, structures, policies, and practices that form societies are inclusive and fair, they create conditions for more sustained progress on issues such as racial equity, reproductive rights, and a strong civil society and thriving civic space. About the Partnership The UC Berkeley-Haas School of Business (through the Center for Social Sector Leadership) offers this unique fellowship in philanthropy at the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to provide next generation leaders the opportunity to engage with philanthropic and nonprofit leaders and work with a grantmaking team serving diverse issues and populations in the RH program. The vision for this partnership is to strengthen the future of philanthropy and civil society by providing recent graduates from diverse disciplines and backgrounds a professional-level introduction to philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. The goals of the fellowship are to 1) introduce recent graduates to philanthropy and the role of nonprofits to strengthen their impact in a future career and 2) introduce the Foundation to fresh ideas, new skills, and diverse perspectives. The fellow will join a cohort of five other fellows at the Foundation working on conservation & science, families and communities, reproductive health, and civil society and leadership.

Strong Communicator: You are great at giving and receiving feedback, presenting ideas to the team, and keeping the team up to date on progress and timelines. We move fast, and constant open communication is key to success in a fast-paced environment. Flexible: You can wear multiple hats and adapt to shifting timelines and goals as we work towards maturing our production process. You are also comfortable taking on both library creation and asset production responsibilities.

The Problem Globally, soils have the potential to sequester over 1 billion tons of carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and emerging solutions like biochar and enhanced rock weathering. However today, measurement, reporting, and verification of soil carbon sequestration is not cost effective, accurate, or scalable. This prevents large-scale climate finance from being deployed to rapidly scale soil carbon improvement despite its massive potential to combat climate change, improve food security, and alleviate extreme poverty. Our Company We're building technology to accelerate gigaton-scale soil carbon removal and storage around the world. To start, we are building the world's best global measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platform to accelerate high-integrity soil carbon sequestration. With Stanfords Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry Lab, we leverage technological innovation using ground truth sampling, remote sensing, and AI modeling to accurately and scalably measure soil carbon. For soil carbon project developers, we decrease the time, cost, and complexity of MRV while increasing the integrity of the carbon removal credits for carbon buyers. This enables the large-scale deployment of climate finance to incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices. We are focused on improving soil health in emerging economies to maximize global sequestration and community impact. We are a public-benefit corporation driven by passion and purpose in service to our planet, people, and prosperity. We are backed by world-class investors including, and aare advised by an all-star team of Stanford climate professors with 100,000+ citations collectively.

Speed and Scale: We value teammates who are ready to move at the speed and scale necessary to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. If you are looking to coast, stick to big tech. Multidisciplinary and Multicultural Collaboration: The ability to think across disciplines and work with people from a variety of backgrounds is not just a requirement, but a unique advantage given that our work spans multiple domains and impacts communities around the world.

As organizations depend on cloud services, the Internet has become their de facto network connecting cloud applications to users. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform is like a 'Google maps of the Internet', providing the only collectively powered view of digital experiences end-to-end. We enable our customers made up of the world's largest and fastest-growing brands, to identify problems before they impact revenue, brand reputation, or employee productivity. In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco's Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco's growing Observability business. About The Position We are looking for a Senior Data Engineer superhero who is passionate about building next generation Analytics infrastructures and products. You will work directly with our data infrastructure, datasets and analytics tools that are used by Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance and Customer Success teams every day. You will contribute to a variety of exciting projects that range from designing robust and fully automated data pipelines to building ML-based applications for improving company-wide productivity and the ThousandEyes product. You have a passion for designing, implementing and operating stable, scalable and efficient solutions that move and analyze large data volumes quickly. You are also a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity, pays close attention to detail and has the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. In the Analytics team we are excited about the impact data can have in our business, product and our customers' experience – we hope you share our enthusiasm!

Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colourful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us. We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

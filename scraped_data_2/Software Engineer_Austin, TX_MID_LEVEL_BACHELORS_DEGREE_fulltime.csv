We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. About our Client Our client is a serverless infrastructure company that has built a global state management platform for web developers. Their mission is to fundamentally change how software is built on the Internet and who gets to build it. They're looking for people who are passionate about improving the development experience for frontend engineers and who have strong opinions on what kinds of tools and workflows will remove barriers to getting things done. The success of our client depends on having an extremely convenient, ergonomic and expressive developer interface. Their initial developer surface area includes libraries for web development in both React and vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript. They also execute user-defined functions in V8 containers server-side to process database queries and need to do so securely and efficiently. What excites them: They are particularly interested in frontend developers with a passion both for developer experience and for the interaction between frontend libraries and backend infrastructure. An ideal candidate for the job would have deep experience with modern web frameworks and standards, packaging tools, and JavaScript library development. There is tremendous scope for motivated frontend developers at the company both to develop their user surface areas, website and dashboard, as well as to influence their query model and developer experience. Qualifications: 5+ years as a web platform, client infrastructure, or frontend infrastructure engineer experienced with TypeScript and well aware of the JavaScript ecosystem Clear communication Ability to create elegant, maintainable code Tasteful API design skills Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Frontend expert with at least understanding of BE plug-ins 3+ years experience Startup (or hyper-growth) experience preferred Location: They view in-person time as essential to make quick strategic decisions, to build empathy and to form early team culture. But they also value that working from home allows productive heads-down execution, extra time with family, commute breaks, and schedule flexibility. So, they're currently following a three/two hybrid schedule: three days in the office and (optionally) two days at home. Therefore, interested candidates need to be either in the Bay Area, New York City or willing to relocate so they're able to attend their office in either location. Fully remote is not an option at this time. Benefits: They have competitive salaries, generous early-employee equity packages, excellent benefits, and lots of plants in the office! Most of all however, they're a group of friendly, highly-motivated people who love working together and hope that you'll love working with them too.

At Deloitte, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. A reasonable estimate of the current range is $118,300 to $241,800. You may also be eligible to participate in a discretionary annual incentive program, subject to the rules governing the program, whereby an award, if any, depends on various factors, including, without limitation, individual and organizational performance. taxttc",https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Data+Architect&l=Dallas%2C+TX&sc=0kf%3Aattr%28FCGTU%7CHFDVW%7CQJZM9%7CUTPWG%252COR%29explvl%28MID_LEVEL%29jt%28fulltime%29%3B&start=100&pp=gQCWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_kIRCAAZAQACus5MKG8mvn_jgMsAsupMOsVifNVibgAA&vjk=14d32c9e5da2f74d

David and Lucile Packard believed that along with universities, national institutions, community groups, youth agencies, family planning centers, and hospitals, foundations constitute a great American tradition that complements government efforts to focus on society's needs. The mission of the Foundation is to work with people and communities to create enduring solutions for just societies and a healthy, resilient natural world. Its vision is a just and equitable world where both people and nature flourish. The Foundation is in the process of framing its new strategic plan. The plan will identify new approaches to how it does its work, examine stronger connections across the issues it funds, and explore new areas of grantmaking that may bring faster, positive change for a more just and equitable world. As the Foundation moves forward to reimagine its future, it is embracing this once-in-a-generation opportunity for transformational, positive change while building on the important work of its partners. About the Families and Communities team The Families and Communities team is developing two initiatives: the California Initiative focuses on ensuring that California communities are resilient, able to respond to and withstand ongoing change and adversity, and equipped to ensure that all residents-children, youth, families, and adults-are able to thrive; the Child and Family Initiative focuses on creating an equitable and sustainable two- generation system of quality care and support from prenatal to age three.

Analyze experimentation data to draw conclusions and make recommendations. Responsibilities Include: Use various sources of data to confirm outcomes based on multiple experiments to enable higher confidence decision making. Ensure standardized data analysis across differing types of experiments such as simulations, wargames, tabletop exercises, and field experiments will be used. This shall include the design of linked experiments using different methodologies, and search across JExNet to identify opportunities to integrate events from different experiment types to increase the analytic strength of overall findings. Include all contextual data along with experiment results in the resultant experimentation reports. Determine how to do analysis and assessment and comparison of event in context of another event to inform gaps/needs and use it in conjunction with other events to draw larger conclusions and assign confidence values to outcomes from different types of events. Analyze Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve (RDER) and Joint Experimentation Network (JExNet) experimentation data to draw independent conclusions and recommend additional experiments by developing standard methods for systematically combining pertinent qualitative and quantitative data from experimentation to develop conclusions that have greater statistical influence. Contribute towards application of statistical approaches for analysis of joint experimentation data. Participate in development of novel quantitative approaches, or customization of statistical methods per project needs. Identify analytical and computational bottlenecks involved in analysis and developing techniques to resolve them efficiently. Ensure appropriateness and applicability of mathematical, statistical, or research techniques utilized, and contribute towards rigorous evaluation and validation. Assist in evaluation and documentation of statistical methodologies used; and prepare recommendations based on mathematical or statistical findings. Participate in report preparation to accurately summarize experimentation design, methods, analysis plans and interpretation of results. Perform meta-synthesis of different experimentation types using Bayesian methods to establish confidence intervals in concept required capabilities (CRCs). Use Bayesian Hierarchy to express different types of experiments: Field/Fleet demonstrations, constructive simulation, modeling, analytic wargames. Desired Skills and Experience: 10+ years of direct work experience with designing and maintaining data models and structures along with data extraction and preparation processes. 6+ years working with data structures/environments with specific experience to include: Validating data, Data Team collaboration, usage of database applications & analytical tools, data query & collection processes providing accurate and appropriate interpretation of data. Desired Education: BS degree in Computer Science, or Data Science; Information Systems, or Information Technology; Electrical, Software, or Systems Engineering.
